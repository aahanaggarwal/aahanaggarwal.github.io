Welcome to the new iteration of my digital space. I've upgraded the visual interface with a CRT monitor overlay, a heads-up display for real-time tracking, and a new neural-link navigation system (the sticky bar at the top).

I'll be using this "Transmission Log" to document my experiments with code, design, and whatever else captures my attention in the tech sphere.

Stay tuned for more updates. End of line.
